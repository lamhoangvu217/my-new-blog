## Exploring Passion and Progress Perception
When searching for keywords like "How to find passion?" or "How to identify your strengths?" on the internet, you'll come across numerous results, ranging from "Tarot card readings for career guidance" to "Palmistry predicting your life," and so on.

Many of these results promise that after spending some money, you'll not only discover your future career but also attain a happy life. I'm not saying these methods are wrong, but I want to illustrate how lucrative the exploration of passion (or future prediction) can be. Many people suggest that to find your passion, you need to experience various things to understand your preferences. While this is true, it's not sufficient.

Suppose you follow the advice to try different jobs and explore. However, in reality, you may find that not many employers are willing to hire someone with no experience. Imagine you are curious about becoming a doctor, but having an IT background, no hospital will hire you without the required medical qualifications. It doesn't make sense to spend an additional four years getting a medical degree just to see if you like it or not. So, the advice to explore various things is only a reference; it lacks a crucial element – progress perception.

## Recognizing Progress Perception
Merely jumping from one task to another without delving deep into a specific area won't bring much change over time, except for gaining more experiences. If you look back after a while, you might realize that not much has changed, except for accumulating more experiences. To truly know if you enjoy a certain job, you must immerse yourself in it for a considerable time. It's only through this continuous engagement that you can sense progress - Progress Perception.

Your passion doesn't arise solely because something is interesting or you were born to love it. It develops because you perceive progress after pursuing it. You feel personal growth every day, even every hour. Let me share a personal example:

In my freshman year of university, I failed an Advanced Programming course (a more challenging version of C programming). The reason was my lack of understanding of fundamental concepts; I lacked a solid foundation. Fast forward to the summer of 2019, I decided to retake the course. This time, I was determined to pass because I understood that it was a foundational course crucial for my studies. My unwavering determination led me to work tirelessly, redoing simple exercises repeatedly until I was familiar, gradually increasing the difficulty. Complex problems became linked to the knowledge from simpler exercises, forming a bigger picture. I understood every problem and the reason I had failed before. I sensed progress.

Feeling progress every day is crucial. It's like generating psychological energy to keep you motivated. Take learning English, for instance. There are times when you're passionate about it, studying day after day. But then there are moments when you feel discouraged and want to give up. Why? You're passionate because you sense improvement. You're disheartened when you don't feel progress. You feel like you're stuck. Even if you haven't perceived progress yet, the lack of progress perception makes you discouraged.

Suppose you're forced to study a subject you hate, like Marxist-Leninist philosophy. You know you dislike it before even starting. However, if you're fortunate to have a good teacher guiding you, making the subject easy to understand, you grasp concepts, achieve high grades, and apply it to your life. You become more confident, and what was once hated turns into something you enjoy.

## Conclusion
This article aims to show that you can be passionate about anything as long as you spend a significant amount of time delving into it. Design your goal pursuit process so that you feel progress every day—consistently. Only then can you go far.
