Hello everyone,

I'm a fairly ambitious person, and sometimes I wish for more than 24 hours in a day 🙄 And of course, that cannot become a reality 🙁. So, I've been thinking about this issue for quite some time, and finally, I have an answer.

The answer is: Automation.

Automation here means finding ways to reduce repetitive tasks that you do every day and can be delegated to machines (or tools). I came across this method thanks to a quote I read in the book "Đừng chạy theo số đông" (Don't Follow the Crowd) by Mr. Kiên Trần. I'll quote the exact words here.

So, how did I automate my learning and working process?

To implement this method, we only need to use two things:

- Startup Program
- [Notion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1454041224987835/permalink/1602659080126048/)

# Startup Program

## 1. Automating Windows

I set up my computer so that every time it starts, it automatically opens Chrome and VSCode (the software I use for programming). These are two programs that I almost always use whenever I turn on my computer. Instead of having to open them individually after starting the computer (or keeping them visible somewhere, like the taskbar), I set them to open automatically. This has saved me a lot of time. So, how did I do it?

### Bước 1. Mở thư mục Startup

First, press the Windows + R key combination to open the Run dialog (or type 'Run' in the search bar to find it). Then, enter the command shell:common startup to open the startup folder.

My Startup folder looks like this:

### Bước 2. Copy the software you want to automatically open into the Startup folder.

Next, select a few programs that you want to open automatically when you start your computer. After making your selections, use the search bar on the taskbar (magnifying glass icon) to find the chosen program. Let's say here I choose Excel. On the right tab, select 'Open file location' as illustrated below.

The folder containing the Excel shortcut will open.

Now you just need to copy that shortcut and paste it into the Startup folder you opened earlier, and you're done.

From now on, every time you start your computer, all the software in this Startup folder will automatically launch. You can add as many programs as you want here, but be careful not to overload your CPU too much.

## 2. Automating Chrome

Another way to automate, which is quite handy, is to set up automation for Chrome.

I will configure it to open specific websites every time I launch Chrome. For example, let's say I want it to open YouTube and Notion. Here's what I'll do:

First, click on the three dots in the top-right corner.

After that, select "Settings."

You then select "On startup."

Select the third option and add the URL of the website you want to open every time you start Chrome.

Then close Chrome, reopen it, and enjoy the results.

> In the past, before knowing this method, I used to forget to check my task list in Notion, but now it's much better. 😪

This method, though simple, helps me save a lot of time in my daily tasks. I hope it will be helpful for you too 😘. This post is probably long enough, so I'll talk about Notion in part 2.
