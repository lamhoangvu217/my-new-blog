## 1. Choose Books
The majority of the books I read are by Vietnamese authors. The reason I prefer books by Vietnamese authors is the familiar narrative style. When reading, many passages make me feel like the author is confiding in me, without unnecessary embellishments, verbosity, or beating around the bush. The Vietnamese author who has left the most impression on me and whose books I enjoy the most is Kien Tran, especially his book "Đừng chạy theo số đông" (Don't Chase the Crowd). Following him is Nguyen Hien with the legendary book "DevUp," among a few others.

I tend to avoid books by foreign authors that have been translated into Vietnamese because, after translation, the writing style often becomes dry and challenging to absorb. I find that I lose interest after reading half of such books. Additionally, foreign authors tend to provide numerous examples but ultimately focus on a single point, unnecessarily convoluted and making me feel drowsy. If I do decide to read a book by a foreign author, I prefer to get the original English version to experience the author's authentic writing style.

Another consideration is the genre of the book. Instead of following trends or recommendations, I believe in selecting books based on my current needs and goals. For instance, if I need a book on time management due to a busy schedule at work, I'll focus on finding the best book on that topic rather than following someone else's reading list.

## 2. Preview the Table of Contents
Reviewing the table of contents helps me understand the book's overall theme and identify chapters that align with my interests. If a chapter I'm interested in is on page 130, I'll skip ahead to that page, ignoring preceding chapters. I do this to maintain a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm while reading. Reading chapters that don't align with my current interests quickly leads to boredom and drowsiness.

Nobody is forcing you to read in sequential order. Jump to chapters that interest you, and enjoy the process.

## 3. Highlight Memorable Quotes
During reading, there are moments when I come across profound statements that I want to remember. The simplest way to do this is using a highlighter pen. Whenever I find a noteworthy quote, I mark it. This makes it easier to locate important passages later.

## 4. Reread a Good Book Multiple Times
I have read "Đừng chạy theo số đông" by Kien Tran three times now. Each time I read it at a different stage in my life, I glean new insights. Rereading a book helps me remember and understand its content better. If you find a book meaningful, don't hesitate to read it again and again to fully appreciate its depth.

## 5. Read Because You Enjoy It, Not Just to Gain Knowledge
My emotional response when buying books remains the same - I buy books because I love reading. I enjoy spending hours engrossed in a book I love, forgetting about time. I'm not concerned with how much it increases my intelligence; I simply find it enjoyable. This mindset has sustained my reading habit for three years.

I may not have an extensive book collection, but I can confidently say that I remember almost every detail from the books I've read. The reason lies in the approach I've mentioned above.
