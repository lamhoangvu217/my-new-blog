## A boy dreams to create value for others via software products
I am a Senior Frontend Engineer from Vietnam with over 4 years of experience. \
My expertise is focused on HTML/CSS/JS, ReactJS, and NextJS. Projects that I've worked on can be viewed in my portfolio. \
I consider myself a person who follows modern web development practices and new technologies, who never stops learning, who is trustworthy, and responsible, respects deadlines, and knows that customer satisfaction is the key to success. \
In addition to this personal blog, I also write technical articles at <a href="https://200lab.io/blog/author/lamvuhoang/" target="_blank">200Lab</a> and <a href="https://viblo.asia/u/lamhoangvu217" target="_blank">Viblo</a>
